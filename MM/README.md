This BOT is 98/2512.

I had too much trouble trying to solve the time-out issue last time so I try to implement the bot without search in this contest.

The result is OK, might be better if we have time to address the target finding function of my Doof and Destroyer.

Currently, my Doof and Destroyer simply run to the nearest enemy reaper.

My reaper is quite nice though, I like it.

There are 18 scoring modules in my reaper's target selection, 4~6 of these modules are still not fine tuned so might also need time to tune them.

Anyway, great contest and great fun.
